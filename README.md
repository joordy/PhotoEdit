# Web App From Scratch

## üî¶ **Description**

In this course I'll learn how to create a single page web application without the use of a framework or unnecessary JavaScript libraries. I use HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript to create this application. With these tools I'll create a virtual dom, including a router. The data is retrieved from a self-selected API and displayed inside the interface.

## üõ† **Features**

My application contains different possibility's. For example, it is possible to search for specific photos using your own search term, select this photo, view all information about it, and edit the photo as desired.

In creating these applications, I used different methods to make my own choices here:

### **Folder structure**

During this course I spent a lot of time writing neat modules. Personally, I like it when my code is clean, this means that I don't repeat myself (DRY), and my files are not hundreds of lines long.

To comply with this I have created several folders. These are all located in my ** utils / ** folder.

```md
src/
+-- js/
| +-- utils/
| | +-- components/
| | +-- config/
| | +-- data/
| | +-- helpers/
| | +-- routes/
| | +-- views/
| +-- index.js
+-- styles/
| +-- components/
| +-- index.css
+-- index.html
```

<!-- #### **Components**

The **components/** folder consists of all kinds of small elements in the elements / folder, which enable me to create HTML elements in JavaScript. Larger blocks of HTML are in the root of the **components/** folder.

#### **Config**

#### **Data**

#### **Helpers**

#### **Routes**

#### **Views**

### **Custom components**

The **components/** folder consists of all kinds of small elements in the elements / folder, which enable me to create HTML elements in JavaScript. Larger blocks of HTML are in the root of the **components/** folder.

```js
export const HeadingOne = (item) => {
  let element = document.createElement('h1')
  let textnode = document.createTextNode(item)
  element.appendChild(textnode)
  return element
}
```

### **Importing elements**

To avoid having dozens of 'import' lines on the first lines of my javascript files, I created an index.js in every folder. This file imports all possible functions from the relevant folder, and ensures that I can import these functions in 1 line of code where necessary. It's a DRY way of importing all the needed functions and variables inside JavaScript.

#### **Example:**

```js
// ‚ùå Bad code
import { functionOne } from './file1.js'
import { functionTwo } from './file2.js'
import { functionThree } from './file3.js'
import { functionFour } from './file4.js'
import { functionFive } from './file5.js'
import { functionSix } from './file6.js'
```

```js
// ‚úÖ Clean code
import {
  functionOne,
  functionTwo,
  functionThree,
  functionFour,
  functionFive,
  functionSix,
} from './index.js'
```

## üìà **Datasets**

For this project I made use of the Unsplash API for Developers. The API gives access to the world largest open collection of high quality photos, totally free. With using different querys, like searching, popular, etc etc, the user can receive a lot of information about the image. All the available information contains:

```js
image = {
  alt_description:  ,           // Second description
  blur_hash: ,                  // Hashed ID
  categories: ,                 // Image categories
  color: ,                      // Color ?
  created_at: ,                 // Created timestamp
  current_user_collections: [], // The current user collection
  description: ,                // Image description
  downloads: ,                  // Total downloads
  exif: ,                       // Camera Settings
  height: ,                     // Image height in PX
  id: ,                         // Image ID
  liked_by_user: ,              // Liked by user
  likes: ,                      // Total likes
  links: ,                      // Links to download information
  location: ,                   // Location of image
  meta: ,                       // Meta information
  promoted_at: ,                // Promoted timestamp
  related_collections: ,        // Related collections with this image
  sponsorship: ,                // Sponsored image
  tags: ,                       // Image tags
  updated_at: ,                 // Updated timestamp
  urls: {},                     // All image URLS, thumbs, small, regular, full, raw
  user: ,                       // Information about user
  views: ,                      // Total image views
  width: ,                      // Image width in PX
}
```
