## 📈 Datasets

For this project I made use of the Unsplash API for Developers. The API gives access to the world largest open collection of high quality photos, totally free. With using different querys, like searching, popular, etc etc, the user can receive a lot of information about the image. All the available information contains:

```json
image = {
  alt_description: // Second description
  blur_hash: // Hashed ID
  categories: // Image categories
  color: // Color ?
  created_at: // Created timestamp
  current_user_collections: []
  description: // Image description
  downloads: // Total downloads
  exif: // Camera Settings
  height: // Image height in PX
  id: // Image ID
  liked_by_user: // Liked by user
  likes: // Total likes
  links: // Links to download information
  location: // Location of image
  meta: // Meta information
  promoted_at: // Promoted timestamp
  related_collections: // Related collections with this image
  sponsorship: // Sponsored image
